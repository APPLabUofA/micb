
Version-2 is the most recent version of the code.

a1 (Sarah) + b1 (Eden)

Dot is good - compared to the fixation cross

Add figures to fixation cross

When it went from almost flat to flat - easier to see

When it matches up to orientation to the gabor opposite 

Head still, moving just the eyes <- will use a head rest

Fades quickly - some variation in people engaging in the motor movement before prompted

Strong sense that a subset of them moved

a2 + b2 

a3 + b3

Add to instructions don't move the mouse until prompted for response

Add a repeat on practice trials

S^3:
-Changed "Incorrect Gabor" to "Incorrect patch" because the stimuli are always referred to as "patches" in the instructions
-Add ! to Correct because it seemed more appropriate 
-Changed breaks so break screen does not show up at the end of practice & end of the experiment
-> I think we will need at least 50+ practice trials cuz I felt like I continued to do improve through 96 trials

Seemed like two Gabor patches moved together sometimes, but often picked the wrong one... 
    check relationship between location of target patch & location of patch incorrectly selected
